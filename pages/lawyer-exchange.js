Our assumption was that the increased efficiency and flexibility for smaller firms should in turn decrease the average cost to access legal services.",

          In my preliminary research, I was surprised to find the idea of
          contract work was not widely adopted in the legal profession even
          though this concept had made its rounds in other industries. This
          would be one of the many quirks (and obstacles to success for our
          product) of the legal profession. Other quirks included:

          Before we fully jumped into development, I hacked a prototype using{" "}
          <strong>React</strong> and <strong>InVision</strong>. I wanted to
          ensure we tested our assumptions to identify important or unnecessary
          features before spending precious time developing them. I facilitated
          both remote user studies and in-person user studies with several legal
          professionals using <strong>Lookback</strong>. The exercise not only
          helped me understand some potential roadblocks with the UI, but also
          gave me some insight into the mental models lawyers use.

          Another important moment in the application was the interaction

          persona we had in mind, it was still important to keep the flow as
          simple as possible. We decided to be as hands off as possible when
          Hiring Lawyers posted a Project Brief and deciding on Project Lawyers
          to hire. On the other side, because the concept of an independent
          "freelance" lawyer is not widely adopted compared to "contract"
          lawyers working at a temp law firm, it was important to design
          empowerment to remind Project Lawyers to take initiative in the
