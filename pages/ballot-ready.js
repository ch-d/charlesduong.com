      <H2>Social Media Ads</H2>
      <Para>My first task was to develop marketing assets for Facebook and Twitter ads. After a period of discovery, we identified their strongest market included adults 45 and up. We found they really enjoyed the potentials of BallotReady, because they were already politically engaged citizens, but didnâ€™t have resources to vote informed all the way down the ballot. In counties like Cook County, Illinois, there were upwards of 100 positions to vote on, and it was often difficult to determine who was actually qualified.</Para>

      <Para>As the deadline of the election neared closer, we decided to address a younger market with data visualizations and blog articles. To reach them, I changed the color palette to include a more modern look with playful colors and tried to recreate simple "trendy" graphics. Our goal with these ads were to reach those less politically engaged, and could portray the image of voting informed in a more positive light.</Para>
