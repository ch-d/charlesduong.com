In March 2016, they recorded data on their personal backend system, but the only method of report was through screenÂ­shots from a third party extension, Mixpanel. The goal for this project was to design a streamlined way for care providers to interact with data about their residents and further inform better care for older adults."

      <H2>Ideation</H2>
      <Para>
        After several brainstorming sessions, we decided to design for the
        interaction between the night time staff and the day time staff. Strong
        communication was present between the staff members throughout the day,
        but it seemed to break down during shift changes. With this in mind, we
        explored ways to help day time staff members to easily observe any
        anomalies when they first come into work.

    <TextBox>
      <H2>Structure</H2>
      <Para>
        We were all new to data visualization, so we wanted to spend time
        understanding how to structure graphs and information. The most useful
        insights came from an{" "}
        <a href="https://medium.com/truth-labs/designing-data-driven-interfaces-a75d62997631">
          article by Truth Labs
        </a>
        , which helped us create a hierarchy where urgent hourly data was at the
        top, a daily view of all residents came next, and any individual
        resident data would be presented at the bottom.
      </Para>
      <H2>Hourly View</H2>
      <Para>
        Their current API gave us the option to make GET requests for timestamps
        of when residents got in and out of bed, as well as any alerts sent to
        caregivers the night before. (Alerts are sent when residents are out of
        bed for a predetermined amount of time.) After several iterations, we
        determined the best way to display this data was in the form of
        something similiar to a gannt chart.

    <TextBox>
      <H2>Daily View</H2>
      <Para>
        While iterating on the daily view, I saw myself repeating processes and
        looked for ways to design a better flow for creating prototypes. Using
        new nested symbols Sketch feature, I worked on a system of symbols and
        styles that represented each state the view could be. I then exported it
        out to a Dropbox folder and synced it up with an{" "}
        <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/K87FSGOWY#/screens/161818578_All-Residents-01-01">
          Invision prototype
        </a>{" "}
        to see if the interactions made sense. This gave us more time to test
        any assumptions we had and iterate further.
      </Para>
      <H2>Resident View</H2>
      <Para>
        After a user found a resident they wanted to investigate further, they
        could navigate to a card with individual hourly, daily, and numbers. The
        resident view placed precendent in the line graph and hard numbers over
        the urgent hourly view. This gave the day time staff a means for more
        thoughtful interactions of long-term trends for individual residents.

    <TextBox>
      <H2>Final Mockup</H2>
      <Para>
        After a month of experimenting with processes and designs, we came up
        with this final mockup. At first, data visualization was a tricky UI
        challenge that seemed too overwhelming to tackle and we did not know
        where to start. But as time went on, each challenge became a little more
        clear. We did not have time to implement the designs as code, but it was
        a strong exercise in understanding design tools and workflows.
